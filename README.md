Sometimes is hard to make decisions,.. let this app decide for you! Based on a life game my friend [CaroChan](https://carochan.com/) taught me when we both lived in London. I still have the die she gave me :)

> When going out, take one die with you. If you don't know what to do, which way to go or you are bored, just asign an action to each number on the die and let the luck decide for you.
